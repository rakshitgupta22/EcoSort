Deep Learning-based Garbage Classification System

## Abstract
Recycling is crucial in minimizing the negative impact on our environment and promoting a sustainable future. By recycling, we can effectively reduce the amount of waste in landfills and mitigate the contamination risks associated with these sites. To make recycling more efficient, we can use machine learning techniques, like image classification, to sort different types of garbage automatically. Deep learning is a powerful form of machine learning which can accurately perform image recognition and object detection, making it ideal for garbage classification. However, accurately classifying garbage poses challenges due to its varying shapes, sizes, textures, and colors. Additionally, obtaining a diverse and representative dataset for training the models is difficult. In this research, we have used the Garbage dataset from Kaggle which has 15150 images divided into 12 categories of household garbage. This dataset was used to train deep learning algorithms suitable for image classification like 13-layer CNN, Transfer learning with MobileNet, ResNet, and VGG to classify Garbage into 12 classes.
